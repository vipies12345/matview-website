    <h1>RLC Load</h1>
    <h3>Why we need load bank testing?</h3>
    <p>
      It is really critical that your standby power system say UPS (uninterrupted power supply), battery bank, generator, transformers, inverter, etc working in good condition if switched to be loaded when the main power supply in maintenance procedure or stops abnormally. Downtime could be reduced by regular maintenance and thorough inspections which are the key to the power supply system’s maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critical power backup equipment like UPS systems and generators which are especially located in harsh, dusty, or corrosive environments will fail without proper preventative maintenance. MatView provides a whole range of custom preventative maintenance product solutions for UPS systems and generators and many more to ensure constant uptime for your power systems and make you prepared for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Load banks help highlight a large range of faults on the equipment it tests. The first objective when testing with an electric bank is to ensure your equipment’s power supply is reliable. The underlying question that needs answering is whether your equipment will have sufficient power supply to ensure uninterrupted operational performance. The load bank also tests that the equipment is not faulty, that there are no faults in construction, that the aging of the equipment is in line with expectations, that the components are reliable, and that there are no pending breakdowns or early signs of wear and tear. The load bank also ensures that the product delivers power conforms to its specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resistive & reactive load banks are able to mimic motor loads and electromagnetic devices within a power system as well as purely resistive loads by offering the ability to set a specific power factor (pf). Many backup generators and turbines are rated at 0.7, 0.8 or 0.85 power factor and need to be commissioned at nameplate capacity using a combination of resistive and reactive load to fully qualify their operating capability. Using a resistive & reactive load bank enables comprehensive testing from a single unit. MatView has an extensive range of resistive & reactive load banks to simulate these types of loads on a power source and the transformers, relays, and switches that will distribute the power throughout your facility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inductive & capacitive load banks are reactive only and must be used in combination with a resistive load bank to provide the desired load profile to test a power system. Reactive loads banks can provide either a leading power factor (Capacitive) or a lagging power factor (Inductive).
    </p>
    <p>
      MatView series AC load bank testing offers you whole solutions of predictive failure analysis for UPS (uninterrupted power supply), generators, transformers, PV system, inverter etc, to validate the condition and output of such power systems comprehensively.
